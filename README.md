# Carzone-Project-1

Car Zone - A Used Car Selling Business Website. 

The basic scenario of this project is a website for a car business owner who wants to list his cars on his website and allow the user to come to his site and browse through all of his latest cars and featured cars, search and filter the cars by model or price, and make some inquiries about his cars that are out for the sale.
